# Design patterns
A simple and small scale project to understand how certain design patterns work
and what problems they solve. This is done via implementation of said patterns in 
TypeScript. 

## Visitor pattern
Although I personally don't think Visitor should ever be implemented in TypeScript or 
any language not supporting overloading methods, but still it's good to implement it just 
to see what it does and how.
